Here are some design decisions and goals for the project.

Python's usage of MRO to call superclass constructors is fundamentally busted IMO
and complicates multiple inheritance a lot in common cases. In this project,
multiple inheritance is handled by calling each required superclass __init__
manually using pre-super syntax. It's a lot easier to write, easier to read, and
easier to understand. MRO is still used for other superclass methods because in
most cases it's very likely that only one superclass has a bound method
with a specifc name.

The GUI should remain as detached as possible from the core functionality and
logic of the application. This is so it is easy to configure the application to
run without the GUI without sacraficing any functionality e.g. "headless mode".
Interaction between the logic and gui should be done through provided "hooks" in
the core logic, and there should be minimal mention of or calls to anything
GUI-related outside the GUI folder (besides the GUI entry point in the main script).
